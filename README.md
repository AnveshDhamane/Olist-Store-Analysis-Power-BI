## Data Modeling

The data model follows a **Star Schema** architecture to optimize performance and simplify DAX calculations.

- **Fact Table:** `Order_Items` (Contains transactional data like Price, Freight, and Quantity).
- **Dimension Tables:** `Customers`, `Products`, `Sellers`, `Payments`, `Reviews`, and `Date` (Calendar).

![Data Model Screenshot](https://github.com/AnveshDhamane/Olist-Store-Analysis-Power-BI/blob/4d479c629ca1d5d62763e3f02b0d883abe1db3b2/Data%20Model.png)

### Model Details:
- **Relationships:** One-to-Many relationships are established between Dimension tables and the Fact table.
- **Star Schema:** The `Order_Items` table acts as the central fact table, connected to `Products`, `Sellers`, and `Orders`.
- **Snowflake Schema:** Used for the `Product_Category_Translation` table, which filters the `Products` table to provide English category names.
- **Date Table:** A dedicated Date table was created using DAX to handle time-intelligence functions accurately.

## DAX Measures & Calculations

This project uses advanced DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create dynamic measures and field parameters. Below is the documentation for the core calculations used in the dashboard.

### 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

These measures calculate the core business metrics shown on the top-level cards.

**Total Payment (Gross Revenue)**
* **Code:**
    ```dax
         Total payment = CALCULATE(SUM(olist_order_payments_dataset[payment_value]))
    ```
* **What it tells:** The total monetary value captured by the platform (includes product price + freight).
* **Used in:** Home Page KPI Cards.

**Total Product Price (Net Sales)**
* **Code:**
    ```dax
        Total price = CALCULATE(SUM(olist_order_items_dataset[price]))
    ```
* **What it tells:** The total revenue generated strictly from product sales (excluding freight).
* **Used in:** Financial analysis views to separate logistics revenue from product revenue.

**Average Payment**
* **Code:**
    ```dax
         AVERAGE PAYMENT = CALCULATE(AVERAGE(olist_order_payments_dataset[payment_value]))
    ```
* **What it tells:** The average transaction value per order. High values indicate customers buying expensive items or multiple items at once.

**Average Price**
* **Code:**
    ```dax
          AVERAGE PRICE = CALCULATE(AVERAGE(olist_order_items_dataset[price]))
    ```
* **What it tells:** The average cost of a single item sold on the platform.

### 2. Advanced Analysis Measures

**Shipping Efficiency vs. Satisfaction**
* **Code:**
    ```dax
    Avg shipping days by score =
    ROUNDUP(
        AVERAGEX(
            VALUES(olist_order_reviews_dataset[review_score]),
            CALCULATE(AVERAGE(olist_orders_dataset[Days taken]))
        ),
        0
    )
    ```
* **What it tells:** Calculates the average number of delivery days for each review score (1-5 stars).
* **Insight:** This measure is crucial for proving the correlation that **faster shipping leads to higher review scores**.
* **Used in:** "Logistics" view, likely in a Bar Chart comparing Delivery Days by Review Score.

### 3. Dynamic Field Parameters

These tables allow the dashboard user to toggle between different metrics on a single chart using a slicer.

**Metric Switcher (Totals)**
* **Code:**
    ```dax
    Parameter = {
        ("Total payment", NAMEOF('olist_customers_dataset'[Total payment]), 0),
        ("Total price", NAMEOF('olist_customers_dataset'[Total price]), 1)
    }
    ```
* **Usage:** Used in trend charts (e.g., "Revenue by Month") to allow users to switch between viewing **Total Revenue** vs. **Product Sales**.

**Metric Switcher (Averages)**
* **Code:**
    ```dax
    AVG parameter = {
        ("AVERAGE PAYMENT", NAMEOF('Parameter'[AVERAGE PAYMENT]), 0),
        ("AVERAGE PRICE", NAMEOF('Parameter'[AVERAGE PRICE]), 1)
    }
    ```
* **Usage:** Used in charts analyzing ticket size to compare **Order Value** vs. **Item Price**.

**Comprehensive Metric Selector**
* **Code:**
    ```dax
    Parameter 3 = {
        ("Total Payment", NAMEOF('olist_customers_dataset'[Total payment]), 0),
        ("Average Payment", NAMEOF('Parameter'[AVERAGE PAYMENT]), 1),
        ("Total Price", NAMEOF('olist_customers_dataset'[Total price]), 2),
        ("Average Price", NAMEOF('Parameter'[AVERAGE PRICE]), 3)
    }
    ```
* **Usage:** Used in the "Grid" or "Deep Dive" views where the user needs full control to swap any metric into the X or Y axis of a chart. *


## Key Insights

### 1. Geographic Concentration
The Southeast region (especially Sao Paulo) accounts for the vast majority of orders and revenue, indicating a need for logistics optimization in other regions.

### 2. Seasonality & Peaks
There is a significant spike in sales during Black Friday (November), requiring scaled-up inventory and server capacity during Q4.

### 3. Delivery Efficiency
While most orders arrive on time, there is a visible gap between Estimated Delivery Date and Actual Delivery Date in northern states, often leading to lower review scores.

### 4. Payment Preferences
Credit Cards are the dominant payment method, with a high usage of installments (Parcelado), suggesting customers prefer spreading costs for higher-value items.

## Recommendations

### 1. Logistics Optimization
Establish warehousing partnerships in the North/Northeast regions to reduce delivery times and freight costs.

### 2. Inventory Planning
Sellers should use the seasonality data to stock up heavily on "Bed & Bath" and "Decor" items specifically for the Q4 Black Friday rush.

### 3. Payment Incentives
Since Credit Card installments are popular, offer interest-free installment promotions to increase the Average Order Value (AOV).
